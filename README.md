# SingleActivityApplication

I typically create something similar for a lot of projects since I don't really need multiple activities, Android is releasing (has released) their
own implementation but I'd rather have something super lightweight that I made myself for use.

I also don't want to use Fragments or some of the other options just to keep a lower memory footprint, which will be a goal of the project.

Next Application I will plan on making with this will be a type of mobile game just to see if any features once this is complete are missing.
